  - The app in step 1 is awesome. Looks great and makes me excited to go through
    the workshop!
  - I've done some random copy editing here and there. I don't mean to remove
    your tone of voice, just improve text I found a little awkward or hard to
    understand. Please feel free to accept or reject any text edits :)  
  - I wish each step had a title / heading to ground me and provide context
    about what this step is about. What is the main topic of each step? What
    should I focus on?
  - Hm, Getting a "script error" when I run Step 2, both with my solution and
    the solution provided by the workshop. Perhaps it cannot request focus as a
    separate panel?
  - Sometimes I didn't see the "Homework" sections. Ironically, the blockquote
    styling kind of de-emphasized those sections for me visually, especially
    when placed underneath a code block. Emoji's & Headings may help the user.
  - In some cases, I felt like code comments might be a bit easier to read than
    a block of code a block of text underneath. Just my style though, again
    please feel free to ignore if you like it the other way :)
  - I like how the early steps sort of guide the reader through how the pieces
    fit together and ignore implementation a bit, then later steps ask the user
    to implement those topics with a knowledge of how the pieces fit together. I
    was worried at first there was a bit too much copy/paste happening, but it
    made sense in the end!
  - It's easy to follow where code should be placed. 
  - Overall, I really enjoyed the content of the workshop! It combined not only
    the keyboard system but it was fun to think about the game logic as well.
    Nice one :)
