Flutter's support for Desktop and Web will bring an extra power for you to run your applications over any platform that you can imagine. 

But do not forget, with great power, comes great responsibility.

As you develop your applications, you are expected to follow the common use-cases of Desktop and Web platforms that you are part of. One of the biggest use-case is _Keyboard Shortcuts_.

In this workshop, you will be learning the following concepts:

- Creating keyboard shortcuts for a single page
- Creating keyboard shortcuts for all application
- Managing focus system with device keyboard

For learning what mentioned above, we will create a word puzzle that we can control with our keyboard. 

The starter project is already prepared for you. Play around with it and get used to it. All functionality works with mouse. You will be given five letters and expected to find a 5 letter word that is defined in our list.

If you are ready, let's go!
